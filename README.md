# diego-mobility-challenge

Notes:
Used OpenWeather for API
Used Windows Forms to make the app simple
Used AppSettings.json to hold configuration data
Using Text as the history log
Given the simplicity of the app, no unit tests were added as it would have added complexity to the logic just for the sake of complexity
