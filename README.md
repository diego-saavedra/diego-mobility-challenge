# diego-mobility-challenge

Notes:

- Used OpenWeather for API
- Used Windows Forms to make the app simple
- Used AppSettings.json to hold configuration data
- Using Text as the history log
- Given the simplicity of the app, no unit tests were added as it would have added complexity to the logic just for the sake of complexity
- To make the app work, the API Key was provided, on a production system this would not be commited
